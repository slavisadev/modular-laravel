- **Versioning strategy**
  - Semantic versioning principles
  - Breaking changes management
  - Deprecation notices and cycles
  - Long-term support considerations
  - Laravel version compatibility matrix
  
  ```php
  // Deprecation example in code
  class YourService
  {
      /**
       * Process the given data.
       *
       * @param array $data The data to process
       * @return array
       * 
       * @deprecated since version 2.3.0, use processData() instead.
       */
      public function process(array $data): array
      {
          // Log deprecation notice during development
          if (app()->environment('local', 'development', 'testing')) {
              trigger_deprecation(
                  'your-vendor/your-package',
                  '2.3.0',
                  'The %s method is deprecated, use %s instead.',
                  __METHOD__,
                  'processData()'
              );
          }
  
          return $this->processData($data);
      }
  
      /**
       * Process the given data with new implementation.
       *
       * @param array $data The data to process
       * @return array
       */
      public function processData(array $data): array
      {
          // New implementation
          return $data;
      }
  }
  
  // Upgrade guide in documentation (UPGRADE.md)
  # Upgrade Guide
  
  ## Upgrading from 1.x to 2.0
  
  ### Breaking Changes
  
  #### Configuration File Changes
  
  The configuration file format has changed. You will need to republish the configuration:
  
  ```bash
  php artisan vendor:publish --tag="your-package-config" --force
  ```
  
  #### API Changes
  
  * `OldService` has been removed. Use `NewService` instead.
  * The `process()` method now requires an array instead of a string.
  * The `getResults()` method now returns a Collection instead of an array.
  ```

- **Documentation best practices**
  - README structure and content
  - Installation and quick start guides
  - API documentation generation
  - Usage examples and code snippets
  - Comprehensive configuration options
